        "# Figuring out F-Sharp\n",
        "## What is F Sharp? \n",
        "\n",
        "According to the homepage of the F# Software Foundation (fsharp.org), “F# is a mature, open source, cross-platform, functional-first programming language. It empowers users and organizations to tackle complex computing problems with simple, maintainable and robust code.” \n",
        "\n",
        "Alright, let’s break that down further: \n",
        "\n",
        "## What is a programming language? \n",
        "\n",
        "The online tech dictionary Webopedia defines a programming language as “a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks. The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages\". \n",
        "\n",
        "## What is a computer? \n",
        "\n",
        "The online tech dictionary Webopedia defines a computer as “a programmable machine. The two principal characteristics of a computer are: It responds to a specific set of instructions in a well-defined manner and it can execute a prerecorded list of instructions (a program).” \n",
        "\n",
        "Well, we will let that stand for the moment. Breaking down the definition of a computer will be a future blog entry (or more likely a series of entries).  \n",
        "\n",
        "## What does high-level language mean? \n",
        "\n",
        "As we already learned, a programing language is used to give instructions to a computer. To simplify it, let’s say it allows us to “speak” to a computer. High-level means in this context, that vocabulary and grammatical rules are close to human language (typically English).  \n",
        "\n",
        "The problem is that the computer (the hardware) doesn’t understand us when we speak to it directly in a high-level language. The computer, at its core, understands only machine language.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Machine language is the lowest-level programming language and is strictly binary (zero or one). A binary code representation for the word hello would look like this: 01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 \n",
        "\n",
        "As can be imagined, machine language is extremely hard to write, read and maintain. Also, not all computers speak and understand the same machine language. \n",
        "\n",
        "In order to give instructions to a computer in a high-level language, the written instructions (the code) must first be translated to machine code. How exactly this is done, will be the topic of future blog entries.  \n",
        "\n",
        "For now, all we need to know is, that there are basically two ways to get from high-level code to machine code:  \n",
        "\n",
        "- the most common way is to “compile” the code. Simply put, the entire code is translated into machine code, and thereby into an executable program \n",
        "\n",
        "- another way is to “interpret” the code. Simply put, each line is translated and executed separately.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Compiled programs generally run faster. On the other hand, interpreted code can be executed much faster which allows quick testing of the code.  \n",
        "\n",
        "## What does functional-first mean? \n",
        "\n",
        "Functional first means, that the primary programing paradigm of the multi-paradigm language F# is functional.  \n",
        "\n",
        "## What is a paradigm? And what is a programming paradigm? \n",
        "\n",
        "There are several different definitions for the word paradigm. In this case, the most fitting would be a methodological concept or basic attitude towards observable facts or events. \n",
        "\n",
        "A programming paradigm is, by this definition, is a methodological concept used within a programming language to solve problems and do tasks.  \n",
        "\n",
        "There are many different programming paradigms, and a single programming language can implement several different programming paradigms. These are known as multi-paradigm languages.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Some important programming paradigms include procedural, object-oriented, declarative and functional. Each of these, and the concept of a programming paradigm itself, deserve a future blog entry.  \n",
        "\n",
        "## So, what does functional mean? \n",
        "\n",
        "Simply said, functional programming treats computation as the evaluation of a mathematical function. Using a function will always produce the same result, which makes the code easy to predict and avoids unwanted side effects.  \n",
        "\n",
        "There is, of course, much more to functional programming, which we will examine in the future.  \n",
        "\n",
        "## What does cross-platform mean? \n",
        "\n",
        "Programs written in F# can run on multiple different computing platforms, such as Windows, macOS, Linux, Android or iOS. Other uses for F# include GPU programming and HTML5 web applications. \n",
        "\n",
        "## What does open source mean? \n",
        "\n",
        "Open source means in this context, that F# is free to accessed and distributed. Its source code can be viewed and modified by everyone. F# is developed by the F# Software Foundation, Microsoft and open contributors.  \n",
        "\n",
        "## What computing problems can F# solve? \n",
        "\n",
        "F# is a general-purpose language, as such it can be used in a wide range of application areas such as enterprise programming, data science, web programming, mobile apps and games, machine learning, cloud programming, financial computing, math and statistics and data access.  \n",
        "\n",
        " \n",
